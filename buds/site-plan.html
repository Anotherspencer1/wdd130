      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[I'm a software engineer, but I love to garden and create a lush paradise for myself and others to enjoy. 
          Over the years I have found myself struggling to find the right plants to survive the local climate, pests, and diseases. 
          I know so many others have had similar issues. With my experience in software and gardening I can create a website to house 
          lists regarding the best plants to grow in each climate, with detailed information about how to care and protect each plant. 
          This can be a centralized site where anyone, novice, or expert, can learn what they need to garden in confidence. 
          Would a resource like this boost your confidence in your ability to garden?]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[My target audience is anyone that gardens. This site will most likely attract those who are just getting into the hobby,
          so I anticipate a lot of new home owners. Therefore, I anticipate that a large majority of the site users will be between 20 to 30. 
          Due to the higher percentage of younger people, this site needs to be optimized for smaller screens so it can be easily accessed via phone.
          I do however, expect some older people with more experience. The site will be well laid out in order to accommadate those without much internet familiarity.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Hardiness Zone Guide</h3>
      <p>
        Third Page: Zones and Plants
        This page is for anyone trying to plan out their garden. They will have hopefully already read the quick start page and are ready to start planting. 
        In gardening we have different zone numbers assigned to the various different climate types in the world. Knowing what zone you live in is essential 
        to picking the right plants and knowing how to care for your garden. The “hardiness zone” is based primarily on the lowest and highest temperatures of 
        each area, and it dictates how well each species of plant will grow in said area. Therefore, this page will be crucial for anyone planning to start a 
        garden. This page will have each zone listed with its respective climate type in order for the user to identify their zone. Once identified the zone 
        description will be followed be a list of commonly strong plants in that zone. This can be an extremely quick and easy way for the user to pick some 
        plants for their garden, or it will serve as a strong guide for the user to know how to find their own plants that fit well with their zone. Along 
        with the zones and plants will be some tips on how to manage your garden to create a microclimate, or change the zone you live in. For example, a 
        greenhouse will raise the lowest temperature of an area dramatically, creating a microclimate that is possible 2 or 3 zones higher than the actual zone 
        of the area. There are several things that can be done with this same effect.
