      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[I'm a software engineer, but I love to garden and create a lush paradise for myself and others to enjoy. 
          Over the years I have found myself struggling to find the right plants to survive the local climate, pests, and diseases. 
          I know so many others have had similar issues. With my experience in software and gardening I can create a website to house 
          lists regarding the best plants to grow in each climate, with detailed information about how to care and protect each plant. 
          This can be a centralized site where anyone, novice, or expert, can learn what they need to garden in confidence. 
          Would a resource like this boost your confidence in your ability to garden?]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[My target audience is anyone that gardens. This site will most likely attract those who are just getting into the hobby,
          so I anticipate a lot of new home owners. Therefore, I anticipate that a large majority of the site users will be between 20 to 30. 
          Due to the higher percentage of younger people, this site needs to be optimized for smaller screens so it can be easily accessed via phone.
          I do however, expect some older people with more experience. The site will be well laid out in order to accommadate those without much internet familiarity.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        Second Page: Getting Started
        Raised Bed, or In-Ground?
          Raised garden beds are growing in popularity, and for good reason. Raised garden beds are going to provide many benefits 
          for those who choose that route. By having the soil raised up it allows the user much more control over the quality of the soil, 
          the weeds and unwanted plants that grow there, pests that can access it, as well as providing a more ergonomic space for tending 
          and harvesting. Some downsides to a raised garden bed involve primarily the cost of building the bed and buying soil to fill it. 
          Either option can be very successful, and the choice is yours!
        
        Expected Costs?
          Gardening can end up saving you money and elevating your life by having fresh grown produce without having to stop by the store. 
          However, getting into the hobby has some cost up-front. Obviously, cost is going to differ for every garden, but one can expect to 
          spend money on tools, soil, fertilizer, seeds, plants, and water. Some tips to save money while gardening: Look for used tools in 
          your local marketplaces, start composting early to get high quality soil for free, buy seeds over plants and start them inside to 
          get a jump on the season for a fraction of the cost, and check for natural fertilizers using things you may already have.
        
        Common Pitfalls?
          Everyone makes mistakes while gardening, it would be wise to accept the fact that you may have some bad harvests, 
          late blooms, diseased plants, and irritating pests. That being said, there are ways to avoid these issues and help 
          you learn quicker. Planning is going to be essential. Try to find a local community where you can discuss plants that 
          do well where you live, frost dates, common pests, common diseases, soil quality, etc. By studying and planning you can 
          cut costs and save some heartache by learning from others mistakes.

      <h3>Hardiness Zone Guide</h3>
      <p>
        Third Page: Zones and Plants
        An important resource for anyone starting to garden is the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map. The Hardiness zones are a set 
        of zone numbers based on lowest temperatures of the area which can guide you in deciding what plants will work well in your 
        area. We recommend that anyone who is starting to plan a garden checks what zone they are in and double check that the plants 
        they choose work well in their zone.
      
          For example, Tomatoes love hotter weather, meaning you can plant earlier in zones 5-7, but you may need to wait until fall 
          if you're in zones 10 and above. Every plant has different preferred conditions, which makes it essential to find out what 
          to plant and when depending on your zone. By researching and planning this way, you can ensure that your plants are happy and 
          healthy all season long.
        
          Greenhouses are a great resource to lengthen your season and create a micro-climate with a different zone from the rest of your 
          yard. If you live in a zone 2 area, your season may be very short making it difficult to get a good yield of produce. However, 
          by planting in a greenhouse you can use the heat of the sun to raise the temperatures and extend the length of your season by a month or more!
