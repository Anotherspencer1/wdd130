            <h2>Raised Bed, Or In Ground?</h2>
            <p>Raised garden beds are growing in popularity, and for good reason. Raised garden beds are going to provide many benefits 
                for those who choose that route. By having the soil raised up it allows the user much more control over the quality of the soil, 
                the weeds and unwanted plants that grow there, pests that can access it, as well as providing a more ergonomic space for tending 
                and harvesting. Some downsides to a raised garden bed involve primarily the cost of building the bed and buying soil to fill it. 
                Either option can be very successful, and the choice is yours!</p>

            <h2>Expected Costs?</h2>
            <p>
                Gardening can end up saving you money and elevating your life by having fresh grown produce without having to stop by the store. 
          However, getting into the hobby has some cost up-front. Obviously, cost is going to differ for every garden, but one can expect to 
          spend money on tools, soil, fertilizer, seeds, plants, and water. Some tips to save money while gardening: Look for used tools in 
          your local marketplaces, start composting early to get high quality soil for free, buy seeds over plants and start them inside to 
          get a jump on the season for a fraction of the cost, and check for natural fertilizers using things you may already have.

            <h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone makes mistakes while gardening, it would be wise to accept the fact that you may have some bad harvests, 
          late blooms, diseased plants, and irritating pests. That being said, there are ways to avoid these issues and help 
          you learn quicker. Planning is going to be essential. Try to find a local community where you can discuss plants that 
          do well where you live, frost dates, common pests, common diseases, soil quality, etc. By studying and planning you can 
          cut costs and save some heartache by learning from others mistakes.
