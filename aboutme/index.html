    <h2>Spencer Sorenson</h2>
    <p>My name is Spencer Sorenson, and I'm currently living in Indpendence, Missouri.
        I got married last April to my beautiful wife Beth. I'm originally from Southern California,
        and served a full time mission in Madrid Spain. I am studying software engineering
        and hope to be a full stack developer.
